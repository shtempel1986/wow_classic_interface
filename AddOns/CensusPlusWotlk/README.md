This is an interface addon for World of Warcraft: Wotlk which records details about characters currently online in your faction at the time of the polling. This is done with liberal use of the in-game /who command via the Wholib. The information is then stored in the CensusPlusWotlk.lua in your account's SavedVariables folder, which could be uploaded to WoWClassicPop.com (made by Scarecr0w12)


## Installing the addon

- Use an unzipping program like 7zip and extract the CensusPlusTBC folder to your addons directory
- The addon directory is usually located here:
-- `..\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface`
- When you log into the game the CensusPlusWotlk addon automatically starts collecting data. You can watch the progress through the minimap icon.
- After the census is taken you get a message in chat how many characters were recorded
- Logout or do a /reload to force the addon to write its data into the *.lua file
- Navigate to `..\World of Warcraft\_classic_beta_\WTF\Account\1234567#1\SavedVariables\` and find the CensusPlusWotlk.lua (1234567#1 is a different number for you or your account name)
- Upload the `CensusPlusWotlk.lua` on `WowClassicPop.com`.
