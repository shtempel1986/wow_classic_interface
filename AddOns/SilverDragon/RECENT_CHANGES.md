## Changed in v2022.33

* More mining of mobs and loot
* Tooltips: option not to show loot while in combat, because MysticalOS complained about it taking up too much space when using mouseover macros
* Custom / ignore options: remember rares seen this session so you can just go into settings and ignore them by checking a box, without needing to look up their ID
* Range extender: hide some of the more inconvenient "mystery" vignettes that're just highlights for NPCs in towns. I have to manually flag these, so I'll improve these over time.
* Added all the treasure-maps to the dragonscale expedition treasures
* Avoid an error that could happen in some weird cases for the popup
* Fix a few rares showing in the wrong map phase in Battle for Azeroth zones
